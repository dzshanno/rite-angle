Question 1 - Stage 1
A  3 cm by  3cm by  3cm cube of white wood is painted black all over, and then chopped into  27 cubes, each   1cm by  1cm by 1cm .

These smaller cubes are then put into a bag and three are picked (without replacement) at random.

What (to 3 s.f.) is the probability of getting exactly four black faces in total?

1 x centre = 0 black faces
6 x face = 1 black face
12 x edgee = 2 black faces
8 x corners = 3 black faces
